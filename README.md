## Intro
This repo is copied from my hugo blog. It takes much time to maintain that since:

1. I want to consider the url stability of a post.
2. The post organization costs too much time.
3. The related asserts organization is too strick.

So just keeping these posts readable in github with markdown format seems a good choice.
