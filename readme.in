# Intro
This repo is copied from my hugo blog. It takes much time to maintain that since:

1. I want to consider the url stability of a post.
2. The post organization costs too much time.
3. The related asserts organization is too strick.

So just keeping these posts readable in github with markdown format seems a good choice.

The format of the repo:
1. Every new notes **must** be prefixed with a 4-length serial number generated from `./nextd.sh`
2. New assets **must** be in the `/assets` directory and prefixed like `${4-length notes prefixed}-${3-length image prefixed}-xxx.suffix`

# TODO
- [ ] Relationship storage in Neo4j
